# Password-Generator

## The general purpose of this code is to take in values from the user to determine what type of code they want. Whether, lower case, uppper case, special characters, numbers, etc. Then the user would verify the type of password they want and then click generate.

## After clicking generate, a random number will determine each character. Then output to the text box. Then the user may click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the new password to the clipboard.
